# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing `yangweijie/filesystem-ctfile`, a PHP filesystem extension package that integrates ctFile functionality with the Flysystem filesystem abstraction library. The package will provide a unified interface for file operations while leveraging the capabilities of both ctFile and Flysystem, enabling developers to work with files across different storage systems with enhanced functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a PHP developer, I want to install and configure the filesystem-ctfile package easily, so that I can quickly integrate it into my existing projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `composer require yangweijie/filesystem-ctfile` THEN the system SHALL install the package with all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for basic setup and configuration
3. WHEN the package is configured THEN the system SHALL validate configuration parameters and provide meaningful error messages for invalid configurations
4. IF the package dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating which dependencies need to be installed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to implement the Flysystem adapter interface, so that I can use it seamlessly with existing Flysystem-based applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the adapter is instantiated THEN the system SHALL implement all required Flysystem adapter interface methods
2. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL return responses in the standard Flysystem format
3. WHEN the adapter is used with Flysystem filesystem THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with all Flysystem features
4. IF an unsupported operation is attempted THEN the system SHALL throw appropriate Flysystem exceptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform basic file operations (create, read, update, delete), so that I can manage files through the unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file write operation is requested THEN the system SHALL create or update the file and return success confirmation
2. WHEN a file read operation is requested THEN the system SHALL return the file contents or throw an exception if the file doesn't exist
3. WHEN a file delete operation is requested THEN the system SHALL remove the file and return success confirmation
4. WHEN a file exists check is performed THEN the system SHALL return a boolean indicating file existence
5. WHEN file metadata is requested THEN the system SHALL return file size, modification time, and other relevant attributes
6. IF a file operation fails THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive exceptions with error details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work with directories and file listings, so that I can manage file structures effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a directory listing is requested THEN the system SHALL return an array of files and subdirectories
2. WHEN a directory creation is requested THEN the system SHALL create the directory structure recursively if needed
3. WHEN a directory deletion is requested THEN the system SHALL remove the directory and all its contents
4. WHEN checking if a path is a directory THEN the system SHALL return a boolean indicating directory status
5. IF a directory operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about the failure reason

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to integrate ctFile-specific functionality, so that I can leverage enhanced file management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ctFile features are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide methods to utilize ctFile's specific capabilities
2. WHEN file operations use ctFile enhancements THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with standard Flysystem operations
3. WHEN ctFile configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and apply ctFile-specific settings
4. IF ctFile functionality is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to standard file operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and monitor file operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file operation fails THEN the system SHALL throw specific exceptions with detailed error messages
2. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log file operations with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN an exception occurs THEN the system SHALL include context information such as file paths and operation types
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose output for troubleshooting
5. IF configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to fix the configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to support multiple storage backends, so that I can use it with different storage systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different storage backends are configured THEN the system SHALL support local filesystem, cloud storage, and remote storage options
2. WHEN switching between storage backends THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent API behavior
3. WHEN backend-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL provide access to underlying adapter capabilities
4. IF a storage backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can trust the package's reliability in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is tested THEN the system SHALL have unit tests covering all public methods
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL test compatibility with different Flysystem versions
3. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the system SHALL handle error conditions gracefully
4. WHEN performance tests are executed THEN the system SHALL meet acceptable performance benchmarks
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about the failure cause

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can implement the package quickly and correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation with method signatures and parameters
2. WHEN looking for examples THEN the system SHALL include practical code examples for common use cases
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide FAQ and troubleshooting guides
4. WHEN upgrading THEN the system SHALL include migration guides and changelog information
5. IF documentation is unclear THEN the system SHALL provide contact information for support

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to follow PHP and Flysystem best practices, so that it integrates well with my existing codebase and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is analyzed THEN the system SHALL follow PSR standards for PHP coding style and autoloading
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use semantic versioning and appropriate version constraints
3. WHEN the package is structured THEN the system SHALL follow standard PHP package organization patterns
4. WHEN interfaces are implemented THEN the system SHALL adhere to Flysystem adapter contracts and conventions
5. IF coding standards are violated THEN the system SHALL be identified by static analysis tools and corrected
